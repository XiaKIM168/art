<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Michel_Basquiat" target="_blank" title="wikipedia">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a> (French: [ʒɑ̃ miʃɛl baskja]; December 22, 1960 – August 12, 1988) was an American artist
who rose to success during the 1980s. Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century,
he was part of the neo-expressionism movement.
Basquiat first achieved fame as part of SAMO, a graffiti duo who wrote enigmatic epigrams in the cultural
hotbed of the Lower East Side of Manhattan during the late 1970s, where rap, punk, and street art coalesced into early hip-hop music culture. By the early 1980s, his paintings were being exhibited in galleries and museums internationally. At 21, Basquiat became the youngest artist to ever take part in documenta in Kassel. At 22, he was the youngest to exhibit at the Whitney Biennial in New York. The Whitney Museum of American Art held a retrospective of his art work in 1992.
